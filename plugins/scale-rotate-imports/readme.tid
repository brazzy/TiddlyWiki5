! Introduction

This plugin scales down imported JPEG images to a sensible size and quality to save space, and autorotates them according to the EXIF orientation.

TODO: 

* Make target width configurable or dependent on the configured width of the tiddlers. 
* Make quality configurable
* Make creation of thumbnails configurable.
